# IP allocation strategy

IP addresses are allocated on a first come first serve basis. We
strongly encourage the use of IPv6 to avoid starvation and simplify routing.

This section documents the strategy and the addresses already allocated. Select a free IP or prefix from this page, then document it on the wiki page of your node.

## IPv6 addresses

We are using an IPv6 space (`fd64:2c08:9fa7::/48`, which allows for 65,536 `/64` networks) known as unique-local addresses (ULA, see below) for our mesh. You can also use your own IPv6 address block, if your ISP offers it, or if you are using a tunnel (such as Tunnel broker). See [[documentation/ipv6]] for more information.

To use a block part of our IPv6 space, select a free IPv6 /64 block from the list, and document it in the wiki page of your node.

This table is automatically generated using the metadata information in the node pages.

<table>
<tr><th>#</th><th>hostname</th><th>IPv6</th><th>IP</th><th>MAC</th></tr>
[[!report pages="nodes/* and (field(IPv6 *) or field(IP *))" template="iptable6" sort="field(IPv6)"]]
</table>

### Note on ULA prefixes

ULA prefixes are "local prefixes" (think like `192.168.0.1`) but that
are unique across sites *and* can potentially be routed between
sites. See [[!rfc 4193]] for more information about this. The Freifunk
project [also uses ULA prefixes](http://wiki.freifunk.net/6mesh.freifunk.net),
`fdca:ffee:babe:dada::/64`.

We are using `fd64:2c08:9fa7::/48` as our prefix. This prefix is advertised
from the mesh, so you should be able to see some routes and your
machine should autoconfigure itself. If you want to use a static IP in that network, document it here
first.

> *Note: the mesh prefix was chosen on
> [SixXS.net](https://www.sixxs.net/tools/grh/ula/), using the MAC
> address of my router. It was also registered there under Anarcat's
> email address.*

## IPv4

The proper allocation for new IPs is in the `172.16.0.0/12` private B
class (from [[!rfc 1918]]). `172.16.0.X/24` is reserved for big
interconnects (like [[nodes/boulette]]), so if you have just a node in
your window, using `172.16.1.X/24` for now (like [[nodes/carton]]).

This is the same table as in IPv6, but ordered by IPv4 address, to more easily find a free block:

<table>
<tr><th>#</th><th>hostname</th><th>IP</th><th>IPv6</th><th>MAC</th></tr>
[[!report pages="nodes/* and (field(IP *) or field(IPv6 *))" template="iptable" sort="field(IPv6)"]]
</table>

## Other Networks in the World

Documented here is our own policies, but we're not alone with this problem. See this [[list on the Open Networks Interoperability Wiki|http://interop.wlan-si.net/wiki/IPAddressing/List]] for IP ranges used by other community networks around the world.
