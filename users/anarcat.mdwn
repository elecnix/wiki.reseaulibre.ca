# My nodes

Here is the list of nodes I operate.

## Operational nodes

## Planned nodes

## Nodes in maintenance

# Todo

 * make the mesh work in my home (./) done with [[nodes/carton]]
 * fix IPv4 allocation to use `172.16.0.0/12` (./) done, see [[configuration/ip]]
 * test IPv6 autoconfiguration [!] having problems with OpenWRT, seems like trunk packages are not in sync with the image i downloaded last week
 * test ipv6 announcement
 * install ganglia? or [[configuration/monitoring]]?
 * aggregate above stats in a table, automatically ([[!iki todo/internal_definition_list_support/]])

# Notes

(!) Power can apparently be pushed up to 84mW (20dBm), see [seattlewireless](http://www.seattlewireless.net/LinksysWrt54g).

# old battle plan

This was the battle plan to configure the OLSR routing and setup on
the roof, but it was short-circuited during the
[[meetings/2012-04-06-antenna-party]].

## Phase I: local tests

 1. setup [[configuration/ad-hoc]] mode between the laptop, the
 linksys and the n900
   * [!] problem here - the laptop doesn't support ad-hoc mode!! see
     [[!debbug 645055]]
   * (!) next step: setup olsrd on the n900, see <http://wiki.funkfeuer.at/index.php/OLSR_am_Nokia_N900>
 2. (./) setup [[configuration/olsrd]] between the nodes (OpenWRT and wired laptop configured)
 3. hookup the linksys to `roadkill.anarcat.ath.cx`, setup [[todo/vpn_gateways]] for outgoing?
 4. think about system-wide [[todo/numbering policy]] (and [[configuration/ipv6]]? - see <http://wiki.freifunk.net/6mesh.freifunk.net> for this)
 5. think about [[configuration/dns]] within the mesh

## Phase II: first link

 1. make panorama of roof
 1. test [opennet's firmware](https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/wiki/Opennet_Firmware_NG) ([for ubiquity devices](https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/wiki/AirOS-opennet))
 2. setup local test environment with martn with two antennas
 3. setup link between the two places
 4. at this point, [[todo/network topology]] should be clear and documented
