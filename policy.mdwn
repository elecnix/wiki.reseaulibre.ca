(!) We need to agree on a policy. This is not yet done!

Usage policy
============

[[Freifunk|http://www.funkfeuer.at/PicoPeeringAgreement.59.0.html?&L=1]] uses the [[Picopeer agreement|http://www.picopeer.net/]], which involve basically:

 1. Free Transit
 2. Open Communication
 3. No Warranty
 4. Terms of Use
 5. Local Amendments

Points 2 and 3 have been strongly supported during our [[first meeting|meetings/2012-02-15-intro/]], while point #1 was not necessarily supported, some having the idea of running VPN-based connectivity services on top of the mesh, like the Opennet initiative does. Terms of use were not discussed explicitly.

Naming
------

A potential local amendment...
