While [Ile Sans Fil](http://ilesansfil.org) does incredible work in providing free wifi access to the community, the goal of creating an alternative network, independant from big corporate providers and decentralized, has remained elusive.

The goal of this project is to create a community wireless network accessible from both fixed and mobile devices that can be used in day to day life by regular people as well as during emergencies. We're building on the experience of [[similar projects|Similar]].

# Status

* [[Map|http://mesh.openisp.ca/ikiwiki.cgi?map=map&amp=&zoom=12&lat=45.52901&do=osm&lon=-73.6004]] - shows where all the nodes are!
* [[Nodes]] - the list of deployed nodes
* [[Links]] - the links between the nodes

# Joining the mesh

* [[Guides]] - step by step config instructions to join the network
* [[Configuration]] - in depth documentation of the various steps

# Technical documentation

This is a wiki, so we expect node operators to share their best practices here and converge on a common set of procedures and tools...

* [[Hardware]] - hardware (routers, cables, antennas) used in the project, and how it's configured
* [[Software]] - the software used/evaluated in the project
 * [[Installation de OpenWRT|configuration/flashing/]]
 * [[OpenWRT avec Batman|guides/openwrt+batman]]
  * Pour d'autres systèmes, voir: [[configuration/ad-hoc]] et [[configuration/batman]]
 * [[Plan d'allocation des adresses IP|policy/numbering]]
* [[Wi-Fi Technicalities]] - basics of the physical layer and mechanics. 
* [[Comment ne pas ralentir un MESH]]
* [[Regulations]] - règlements pertinents au mesh: municipal, fédéral, pose d'antennes, puissance, etc
* [[Policy]] - what we agree on when opening a node on the mesh
* [[Idees]] - possible uses for the mesh
* [[Meta]] - gestion de ce wiki
* [[Similar projects|similar]] - autres projets sur lesquels on s'inspire et avec lesquels on communique
