*************************************
Relationship between Watts and dBm :
*************************************

The watt is a measure of power.

The dBm is a logaritmic representation of gain.

The difference in dBm between two power levels is 10(log p1/p2)

Everytime the power doubles, we add 3 dBm

The reference is 0dBm = 1 mW
