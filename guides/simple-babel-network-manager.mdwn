[[!meta title="Simple Network Manager configuration for Babel"]]

This page documents how to configure network manager to automatically
start Babeld when it connects to a `reseaulibre.ca` wireless ad-hoc
hotspot.

Connecting your laptop to the mesh then becomes as simple as choosing
the network conexion.

This is designed for Wireless connexions, but can also be adapted to
wired connexions.

## Adhoc network manager configuration

This assumes you have already tried connecting to a ad-hoc cell named
`relais.reseaulibre.ca`. If that is not your case, try to find one and
connect to it as a regular hotspot - it will fail but at least it will
be in your list of networks.

 1. Right-click on the network-manager icon
 2. Choose `Edit connexions` (can also be launched through
 `nm-connection-editor`)
 3. Choose the `Wireless` tab
 4. Click on `relais.reseaulibre.ca` in the list and then `Edit...`
 5. Choose the `IPv4 Settings`
 6. Choose `Link-Local Only`
 7. Click `Save...`
 8. Click `Close`

This will make sure Network Manager will not try to get an IP using
DHCP on the ad-hoc network.

## Automatically starting babeld

Network Manager has ways to automatically run scripts after a
connexion is configured, in `/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/`.

### Debian-specific

(!) In Debian, there is a single hook that calls the "ifup" scripts
defined in `/etc/network/if-up.d`, but this could be adapted to a
network-manager-only setup.

Place the following script in `/etc/network/if-up.d/reseaulibre-babel`:

    #!/bin/sh -e
    
    if iwgetid -m | grep -q Ad-Hoc && iwgetid | grep -q reseaulibre; then
        babeld -D -g 33123 "$IFACE"
    fi

Place the following in `/etc/network/if-post-down.d/reseaulibre-babel`:

    #!/bin/sh -e
    
    if [ -e /var/run/babeld-reseaulibre.started ] ; then
    	kill `cat /var/run/babeld.pid`
    	rm /var/run/babeld-reseaulibre.started
    fi

Note: the above scripts could probably merged in one and ported to the
`dispatcher.d` configuration... Patches welcome. :)
