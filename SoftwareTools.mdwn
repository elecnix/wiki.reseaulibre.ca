# Routing protocols

## OLSR

[OLSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimized_Link_State_Routing_Protocol)
(or the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol)

### Implementations

* [OLSRd](http://www.olsr.org/)
* [NRL-OLSR](http://cs.itd.nrl.navy.mil/work/olsr/index.php)
* [wmolsr](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wmolsr/)

Part of the Robin firmware (see below).

## B.A.T.M.A.N.

Implemented by the folks at [Freifunk](http://freifunk.net),
[B.A.T.M.A.N.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.A.T.M.A.N.) (Better
Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking) is intendended to be a
replacement for OLSR.

### Implementations

Freifunk seem to be the sole implementors of this protocol (?). The
first and second version were using UDP (port 1966) for propagating
route information, and were implemented as a daemon (batmand). The
third implementation switched to layer 2 for routing advertisement and
is now implemented in the kernel (batman-adv).

## Robin

Based on [OpenWrt](http://openwrt.org),
[Robin](http://www.robin-mesh.com/) seems to be a fairly complete
solution integrating BATMAN and a GUI. See [[RobinConfiguration]] for
our notes on how to configure robin.
