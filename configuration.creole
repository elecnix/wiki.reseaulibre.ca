= Configuration guides =

This page details how to configure your [[hardware]] for operation in
the mesh.

* [[ad-hoc]] - configuration ad-hoc de base, sans mesh
* [[olsr+ipv6]] - configuration avec OLSR, IPv6 sur un [[nanostation]]

= Network topology =

We need to decide of a topology. Opennet has an interesting concept, where public IPs are hidden behind VPN gateways:

This has a few advantages:

 1. strong over-the-air encryption
 2. no need to change gateway if network topology changes
 3. access to the internet only to subscribers

= IP allocation =

We also need to think about how IPs are allocated, a constant sticky problem in mesh networks. [[reseaucitoyen.be|http://reseaucitoyen.be/]] are suggesting to use IPv6 with the nodes' MAC addresses as a base, with tunnels for inter-mesh communication. The non-MAC part of the address remains to determine obviously...
