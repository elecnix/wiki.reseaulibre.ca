[[!wikipedia Ad-hoc_network desc="Wikipedia"]] has a good description of the different [[!wikipedia Ad-hoc_network]] we can deploy. They mention:

* [[!wikipedia MANET]] - Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks
* [[!wikipedia WMN]] - Wireless Mesh Networks
* [[!wikipedia WSN]] - Wireless Sensor Networks

So which one is it? The idea here is to read up on this documentation too.
