We need to think about how IPs are allocated, a constant sticky problem in mesh networks. [reseaucitoyen.be](http://reseaucitoyen.be) are suggesting to use IPv6 with the nodes' MAC addresses as a base, with tunnels for inter-mesh communication. The non-MAC part of the address remains to determine obviously...

Freifunk have been using unallocated IP space. Opennet has been using `192.168.0.0/16`.

So far, i've been using `10.0.0.0/8`, but we should really look at [[documentation/ipv6]]. See also <http://wiki.freifunk.net/6mesh.freifunk.net>.

Update: [[done]], see [[documentation/ip]] for configuration et [[policy/numbering]] for policy and allocation.
