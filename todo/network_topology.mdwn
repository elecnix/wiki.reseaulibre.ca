We need to decide of a topology. Opennet has an interesting concept, where public IPs are hidden behind VPN gateways:

This has a few advantages:

 1. strong over-the-air encryption
 2. no need to change gateway if network topology changes
 3. access to the internet only to subscribers

We are also considering ad-hoc mode and OLSR, see [[todo/network_topology]].

Some more tests are required but so far i am thinking of:

 * [[configuration/olsrd]]
 * [[configuration/ad-hoc]] mode
 * [[todo/vpn_gateways]] over that for global network access

We also need to figure out how [[nodes]] are interconnected, at the physical level. Do we want a tree?
