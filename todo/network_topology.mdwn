We need to decide of a topology. Opennet has an interesting concept, where public IPs are hidden behind VPN gateways:

<https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/w/images/3/3d/Opennet-Struktur-VPNGateways.png>

This has a few advantages:

 1. strong over-the-air encryption
 2. no need to change gateway if network topology changes
 3. access to the internet only to subscribers

We are also considering ad-hoc mode and OLSR, see [[todo/network_topology]].

Some more tests are required but so far i am thinking of:

 * [[documentation/olsrd]]
 * [[documentation/ad-hoc]] mode
 * [[todo/vpn_gateways]] over that for global network access

We also need to figure out how [[nodes]] are interconnected, at the physical level. Do we want a tree?

Update: we should consider this mostly [[done]] - we are using [[documentation/ad-hoc]] mode with [[documentation/BATMAN]] or [[documentation/babeld]] on top. the [[todo/vpn_gateways]] todo remains for the VPN part, but we are still thinking of using vpns to connect disconnected segments. --[[anarcat]]
