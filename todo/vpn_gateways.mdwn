[[!meta description="How to setup secure gateways to the internet"]]

This is about having gateways to the "real internet" available in the mesh, but only behind a VPN, a service that could be paid to finance the mesh.

Just a brainstorm for now:

 1. no default route (0.0.0.0) should be announced unless people are really nice and want to give out free (and insecure) internet
 2. let's use [[configuration/openvpn]]?
 3. we need to distribute certificates
 4. how do give access? through a client cert? or username/password? how do we revoke it?
 5. the bug in the [[olsrd]] routing is a big issue: we can't setup a VPN if we can't ping the remote host!

Update: [[configuration/openvpn]] tests started, but no clear result yet. Other alternatives: IPsec, tinc and cjDNS, in order of personnal preference.. --[[anarcat]]
