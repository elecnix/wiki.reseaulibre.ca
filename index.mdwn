While [Ile Sans Fil](http://ilesansfil.org) has done incredible work in providing free wifi access to the community, the goal of creating an alternative network, independant from big corporate providers and decentralized, has remained elusive.

The goal of this project is to create a community wireless network accessible from both fixed and mobile devices that can be used in day to day life by regular people as well as during emergencies.

# The map!

The [[map]] page is a good starting point, showing where all the nodes are!

Those pages also have more information:

* [[Nodes]] - the list of deployed nodes
* [[Links]] - the links between the nodes

# Technical information

There is no good step-by-step manual on how to setup a relay or connect to the mesh just yet, but the following documentation should provide you with some pointers.

This is a wiki, so we expect node operators to share their best practices here and converge on a common set of procedures and tools...

* [[Hardware]] - hardware used in the project, and how it's configured
* [[Software]] - the software used in the project...
* [[Configuration]] - step by step config instructions to join the network
* [[Wi-Fi Regulations]] - Ce que Industrie Canada nous demande de respecter
* [[Wi-Fi Technicalities]] - Basics of the physical layer and mechanics. 
* [[Montreal Regulations]] - Réglements pertinants de la Ville de Montréal

# Participating

We need volunteers! On parle français aussi!

* [[Mailing list|https://listes.koumbit.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/nodes-lists.openisp.ca]] - mailing list de discussion de nodes enregistrés, destinée aux bénévoles - avant de demander sur la liste, voir la [[FAQ|foire aux questions]]
* [[Volunteers]] - register here and tell us what you can do
* [[Todo]] - the tasks on hand
* [[FAQ]] - frequently asked questions
* [[Policy]] - what we agree on when opening a node on the mesh
* [[Idees]] - possible uses for the mesh

## Prochaine rencontre

À déterminer!

# Meta

Ce wiki est bilingue - le contenu peut être soit en français, soit en anglais selon l'auteur ou les circonstances (e.g. beaucoup de documentation technique est souvent en anglais).

This wiki is bilingual - the content can be in english or in french depending on the author or the circumstances (e.g. a lot of technical documentation is often in english).

This wiki is designed to be distributed (as in: no single point of
failure!) and redundant (as in: multiple copies) so you should be able to clone it and edit it offline if you
need to. See [[meta/Replication]] for more information. There is also the [[meta/Maintenance]] documentation.

In short, you can clone and push this wiki through git using this:

    git clone git://mesh.openisp.ca/
    git push

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does too.
