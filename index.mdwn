While [Ile Sans Fil](http://ilesansfil.org) has done incredible work in providing free wifi access to the community, the goal of creating an alternative network, independant from big corporate providers and decentralized, has remained elusive.

The goal of this project is to create a community wireless network accessible from both fixed and mobile devices that can be used in day to day life by regular people as well as during emergencies.

# Meta

This wiki is designed to be distributed (as in: no single point of
failure!) and redundant (as in: multiple copies) so you should be able to clone it and edit it offline if you
need to. See [[meta/Replication]] for more information. There is also the [[meta/Maintenance]] documentation.

All wikis are supposed to have a [[SandBox]], so this one does too.
