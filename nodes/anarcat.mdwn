# battle plan

 1. setup [[configuration/ad-hoc]] mode between the laptop, the linksys and the n900
 2. setup [[configuration/olsr]] between the nodes
 3. hookup the linksys to `roadkill.anarcat.ath.cx`, setup vpn for outgoing?
 4. think about system-wide [[configuration/numbering]] (and [[configuration/ipv6]]?)
 5. think about [[configuration/dns]] within the mesh
 5. test [opennet's firmware](https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/wiki/Opennet_Firmware_NG) ([for ubiquity devices](https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/wiki/AirOS-opennet))?
