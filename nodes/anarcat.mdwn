A node on my roof.

    hostname: mesh0.anarcat.ath.cx
    MAC address: 00:90:4c:5f:00:2a
    IP address: 10.0.1.1
    IPv6 address: N/A
    Software: OpenWRT backfire
    Hardware: Linksys WRT54G 1.1
    Power: 15dBm/28mW (default)
    Location: not deployed
    Azimuth: N/A
    Panorama: N/A

(!) Power can apparently be pushed up to 84mW (20dBm), see [seattlewireless](http://www.seattlewireless.net/LinksysWrt54g).

# battle plan

 1. setup [[configuration/ad-hoc]] mode between the laptop, the
 linksys and the n900
   * [!] problem here - the laptop doesn't support ad-hoc mode!! see
     [[!debbug 645055]]
   * (!) next step: setup olsrd on the n900, see <http://wiki.funkfeuer.at/index.php/OLSR_am_Nokia_N900>
 2. setup [[configuration/olsrd]] between the nodes
   * (./) OpenWRT and wired laptop configured
 3. hookup the linksys to `roadkill.anarcat.ath.cx`, setup vpn for outgoing?
 4. think about system-wide [[configuration/numbering]] (and [[configuration/ipv6]]?)
 5. think about [[configuration/dns]] within the mesh
 5. test [opennet's firmware](https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/wiki/Opennet_Firmware_NG) ([for ubiquity devices](https://wiki.opennet-initiative.de/wiki/AirOS-opennet))?
