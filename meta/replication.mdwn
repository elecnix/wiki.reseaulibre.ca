This wiki is designed to be distributed and "redundant" (as in having
multiple copies). Basically, this is to allow you to access the
documentation even if the network goes down. This is done through
[[ikiwiki]], which is a the engine behind this wiki.

(!) Note that this is all much easier with the "branchable" plugin of
the [[ikiwiki-hosting|http://ikiwiki-hosting.branchable.com/]] package.

# Basic offline editing and sharing

Basically, this wiki is a collection of [[ikiwiki/markdown]]-formatted pages
committed to a git repository. The git repository can be freely cloned
using this command:

    git clone git://mesh.openisp.ca/

This will at least provide you with the raw source, the text files
that generate the wiki website. There you can make changes and send me
the patches by email.

# Creating a mirror

To create a mirror of this wiki, if it ever goes down, you can start
from the above repository and create a new wiki.

The following steps should get you going:

    git clone --bare git://mesh.openisp.ca/
    git clone mtl-mesh-wiki.git
    cd mtl-mesh-wiki
    edit meta/mtl-mesh-wiki.setup # fix paths
    ikiwiki --setup meta/mtl-mesh-wiki.setup

See also [[meta/Maintenance]] for the plugins to enable and the hooks
configuration.

(!) Oh, and [this](http://piny.be/jrayhawk/notes/ikiwiki_creation/)
may also be of use if the above doesn't work.

# Merging back into the wiki

Now that multi-user configuration is enabled in the wiki (see [[maintenance]]), i can allow git over SSH access for people that are into that kind of stuff, just ask here or by email.
