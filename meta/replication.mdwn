This wiki is designed to be distributed and "redundant" (as in having
multiple copies). Basically, this is to allow you to access the
documentation even if the network goes down. This is done through
[[ikiwiki]], which is a the engine behind this wiki.

# Basic offline editing and sharing

Basically, this wiki is a collection of [[ikiwiki/markdown]]-formatted pages
committed to a git repository. The git repository can be freely cloned
using this command:

    git clone http://anarcat.ath.cx/software/mtl-mesh-wiki.git/

This will at least provide you with the raw source, the text files
that generate the wiki website. There you can make changes and send me
the patches by email.

# Creating a mirror

To create a mirror of this wiki, if it ever goes down, you can start
from the above repository and create a new wiki.

The following steps should get you going:

    git clone --bare http://anarcat.ath.cx/software/mtl-mesh-wiki.git/
    git clone mtl-mesh-wiki.git
    cp mtl-mesh-wiki/WikiMaintenance/mtl-mesh-wiki.setup .
    edit mtl-mesh-wiki.setup # fix paths
    ikiwiki --setup mtl-mesh-wiki.setup

See also [[meta/Maintenance]] for the plugins to enable and the hooks
configuration.

(!) Oh, and [this](http://piny.be/jrayhawk/notes/ikiwiki_creation/)
may also be of use if the above doesn't work.
