This wiki is designed to be distributed and "redundant" (as in having
multiple copies). Basically, this is to allow you to access the
documentation even if the network goes down. This is done through
[[ikiwiki]], which is a the engine behind this wiki.

(!) Note that this is all much easier with the "branchable" plugin of
the [[ikiwiki-hosting|http://ikiwiki-hosting.branchable.com/]] package.

# Basic offline editing and sharing

Basically, this wiki is a collection of [[ikiwiki/markdown]]-formatted pages
committed to a git repository. The git repository can be freely cloned
using this command:

    git clone git://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/

This will at least provide you with the raw source, the text files
that generate the wiki website. There you can make changes and send me
the patches by email.

# Creating a mirror

To create a mirror of this wiki, if it ever goes down, you can start
from the above repository and create a new wiki.

The following steps should get you going:

    git clone git://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/ wiki.reseaulibre.ca
    cd wiki.reseaulibre.ca
    git branch setup origin/setup
    cd ../
    git clone -b setup wiki.reseaulibre.ca setup
    cd setup
    edit ikiwiki.setup # fix paths
    ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup

Sample configurations:

    cgiurl: http://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/ikiwiki.cgi
    cgi_wrapper: /home/anarcat/public_html/ikiwiki.cgi
    srcdir: /home/anarcat/wikis/wiki.reseaulibre.ca
    destdir: /home/anarcat/public_html/wiki.reseaulibre.ca
    libdir: /home/anarcat/wikis/wiki.reseaulibre.ca/.ikiwiki
    git_wrapper: /home/anarcat/wikis/wiki.reseaulibre.ca/.git/hooks/post-commit
    git_test_receive_wrapper: /home/anarcat/wikis/wiki.reseaulibre.ca/.git/hooks/pre-receive
    gitorigin_branch: "" # disable
    ENV:
      TMPDIR: /home/anarcat/tmp

Disable the `search`, `ikiwikihosting` and `branchable` plugins.

Another guide is the [[!iki tips/laptop_wiki_with_git]] guide. To get a
better understanding of how ikiwiki works, see [[!iki rcs/git]].

Once the wiki can generate pages, you may need to go over the
[[meta/Maintenance]] guide for the plugins to enable and the hooks
configuration.

You will also need a webserver to serve the content in the `destdir`
defined above. This configuration varies wildly, but the ikiwiki
documentation ([[!iki setup]] and [[!iki tips/dot_cgi]]) has some
hints.

(!) Oh, and [this](http://piny.be/jrayhawk/notes/ikiwiki_creation/)
may also be of use if the above doesn't work.

There is some work being done to host copies of this wiki on OpenWrt nodes. See [[meta/ikiwiki+openwrt]].

# Keeping the mirror up to date

There are two options here. One is to regularly pull from the master (less reliable, klunky, but doesn't require cooperation from the master), the other is to make the master push to the mirror. For this, the master needs to enable the [[!iki plugins/gitpush]] plugin and add the following to the setup file:

    git_push_to:
    - ssh://user@example.com/source.git

The repository URL above needs to point to the "repository" directory of the mirror, see the [[!iki rcs/git]] documentation for a good explanation of the layout of the different git repositories in ikiwiki.

It also needs to allow the following SSH key to push to the repository:

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDQsHWlypnPe+4e0mKkE51oDHK2yXrEeja6299Es/wFvqihvzY4hQhJdUdl2KVmz5CGjRYqhnQ8l5Al5vtHoi9IxlI7yS7cOsj/wFt4EKDophqoyUFDaiWtXuFCNYwdTeX5Fb9N6nT8ihUUK/q9k8Ew9kuBTbznsVra5zqJv+LhfAMIesPwmP6iF966Evi0uXxz0CkIevttvYgRZyPIvdVN90nr5f7um1vOP6L1KkQne8guHpuNfxd9XZg0e3XPG6decGREy8jdOc3xlIADc+yxKpB+XqZyE3iYi2RsxnjqWbSURvOhvI5z4EVj5Qv8ktSj8g3LkukQr25EgNMl1cv9 r-wiki@marcos

# Publishing the mirror

Once your mirror works, it needs to be added to the list of mirrors. You can ask the mirror where you take it from (and why not, all mirrors) to add it to their setup file. As an example, here's the configuration for the first mirror:

    mirrorlist:
      deuxpi: https://reseaulibre.deuxpi.ca/

The [[!iki plugins/mirrorlist]] plugin of course needs to be enabled.

# Merging back into the wiki

The final step is to make edits on the mirror reflect back to the master site. That way the mirror is not only for reading, but can also be edited, even when the master is offline or the network is separated.

To do this, the mirror needs to push back to the master, again using the gitpush plugin:

    git_push_to:
    - git://wiki.reseaulibre.ca/

This will ensure that commits done on the mirror will propagate back to the master.
