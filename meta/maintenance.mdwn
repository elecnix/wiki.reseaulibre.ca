# Overall configuration

This wiki was created using the default [[!iki setup]]
instructions. The resulting .setup file is available through the setup
branch of the git checkout in case this wiki needs to be
reconstructed. Eventually, the wiki was redeployed using the Ikiwiki
mass-hosting software called
[[ikiwiki-hosting|http://ikiwiki-hosting.branchable.com/]], but you
should be able to deploy a simple clone using vanilla Ikiwiki. See
[[replication]] for more information on how to deploy that.

See the branchable tab above to clone this wiki.

## HTTP acceleration and performance

First, [[ikiwiki]] is designed to serve static pages, which is very efficient. Unless the wiki gets edited a **lot**, there should be no performance issues hosting it. Also, the wiki emits headers (E-Tag and Last-Modified) based on the content, which means that pages are cached by proxies and your browser will not fetch new data until it is told so or the page changes, which is very useful. This seems to be the default Apache configuration on my machine...

## License

The wiki content is under GFDL, as detailed in the footer. A [[!iki plugins/meta]] tag is in every page to document that fact, and that is enforced through the edit templates below.

## Theme

The [[!iki plugins/theme]] (actiontabs) was slightly tweaked to have the footer display properly, based on the work at the [[GNU HURD wiki|http://www.bddebian.com/~hurd-web/]]. For this, the [[local.css]] file was created and can be modified through git.

the box.

### Possible plugins to enable

* [[!iki plugins/anonok]] - may provoke a deluge of spam
* [[!iki plugins/favicon]] - once we have an icon (but can't we just edit favicon.ico in the root of the wiki?)

## Templates

This section documents which templates are available and to what pages they apply, see also the [[!iki plugins/editemplate]] plugin.

 * [[!edittemplate template="templates/node" match="nodes/*"]]
