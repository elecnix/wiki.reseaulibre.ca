# Overall configuration

This wiki was created using the default [[!iki setup]]
instructions. The [[resulting .setup file|meta/mtl-mesh-wiki.setup]] is available
[[here|meta/mtl-mesh-wiki.setup]] in case this wiki needs to be
reconstructed, although that copy may be out of date.

## Publishing the wiki source

To publish the source, I use a regular HTTP server. For this, I had to
change the post-update hook as described
[[!iki todo/call_git-update-server-info_from_post-udpate_hook desc="here"]],
which means specifically changing the git-wrapper parameter to:

	git_wrapper => '/home/anarcat/public_html/software/mtl-mesh-wiki.git/hooks/post-update.ikiwiki

then creating the post-update hook with the following content:

    #!/bin/sh
    
    ./hooks/post-update.ikiwiki
    
    exec git update-server-info

... and setting it executable. Then the URL of the repository can be
published through the repolist plugin:

	repositories => [qw{http://anarcat.ath.cx/software/mtl-mesh-wiki.git/}],

See [[meta/Replication]] for instructions on how to replicate this wiki.

## HTTP acceleration and performance

First, [[ikiwiki]] is designed to serve static pages, which is very efficient. Unless the wiki gets edited a **lot**, there should be no performance issues hosting it. Also, the wiki emits [[etags|http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19]] based on the content, which means that pages are cached by proxies and your browser will not fetch new data until it is told so or the page changes, which is very useful. This seems to be the default Apache configuration on my machine...
