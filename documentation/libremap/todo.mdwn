Todo list of things to figure out with [[libremap]] before we can formally recommend it to Réseau libre:

* ✔ How to create links between routers? (must set an 'alias', then define 'links')
* ✔ Export data from the wiki: [[https://github.com/mlutfy/ikimaptolibremap]]
* Have a user-friendly way to add new routers to the map (long/lat position)
* Have a user-friendly way to include a mini-map on the relay page.
* Have a link from the map to the node page (there is an "attribute" in the JSON popup, and the URL is imported during the conversion with ikimaptolibremap).

Other things that we do not currently have, but would be nice:

* Have a filter for 'servers'? (to find services)
* Filters: there is an option to show only APs, but not:
 * show only routers
 * show only "up/planned/potential" routers
