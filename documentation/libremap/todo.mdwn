Todo list of things to figure out with [[libremap]] before we can formally recommend it to RÃ©seau libre:

* How to create links between routers?
* Filters: there is an option to show only APs, but not:
** show only routers
** show only "up/planned/potential" routers
* Have a user-friendly way to add new routers to the map (long/lat position)

Other things that we do not currently have, but would be nice:

* Have a filter for 'servers'? (to find services)
