You may have noticed that some commands, such as babelstatus, display MAC addresses, and tried to match these adresses to your network interfaces. Do no more! You can use our `ethers` file to let these tools display nice, user-friendly names that will make it easier to lookup the corresponding entry in the [[nodes]] database.

Here's a list of suggested MAC address to hostname translations. This can be added directly to your `/etc/ethers`. It is generated automatically from the MAC address located in the node details page of a node.

PS: note that some old nodes are still hardcoded here. Please add your MAC address to your [[node|nodes]] page in this wiki.
