# Methodology: iperf

Methodology used is based on that of HWMN (see page footer). We run 3 tests to simulate various types of transfers. All tests assume that one end is running the iperf server.

In TCP mode:

    iperf -s

In UDP mode:

    iperf -u -s

If using IPv6, add the "-V" option.

The other end runs the iperf client "-c" mode (see examples below).

1- TCP mode

    iperf -c 10.176.7.2

The output will look like this:

    -------------------------------------------------- ---------
    client connecting to 10.176.7.2, TCP port 5001
    TCP window size: 16.0 KByte (default)
    -------------------------------------------------- ----------
    [6] local 10.176.7.71 port 39579 connected with 10.176.7.2 port 5001
    [ID] Interval Transfer Bandwidth
    [6] 0.0-10.0 sec 26.3 MBytes **22.1 Mbits / sec**

In that test, the speed result was 22.1 mbps.

2- UDP mode (5 mbps)

    iperf -c 10.176.7.2 -u -b 5m -r

Result:

    [...]

3- UDP mode (10 mbps)

    iperf -c 10.176.7.2 -u -b 10m -r
