# Methodology: iperf

We run 3 tests to simulate various types of transfers. All tests assume that one end is running the iperf server:

   iperf -s

and the other end is running the iperf client "-c" mode (see examples below).

1- TCP mode

2- UDP mode (5 mbps)

3- UDP mode (10 mbps)

# Examples from other organisations using similar hardware

The methodology was based on that of HWMN:

* HWMN (Greece): [[http://wiki.hwmn.org/w/NanoBridge_M5_OpenWRT_Benchmarking]]
 * [[English Google translation|http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=el&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.hwmn.org%2Fw%2FNanoBridge_M5_OpenWRT_Benchmarking&sandbox=1]]
