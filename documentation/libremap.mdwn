# Installation on Debian (unstable/jessie)

We will need to compile 'geocouch' manually, since it is not yet packaged in Debian.

Install dependancies to build geocouch from source:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install build-essential erlang libicu-dev libmozjs-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
 libtool automake checkinstall
</pre>

Install the couchdb source:

<pre>
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
apt-get source couchdb
</pre>

Download the geocouch source:

<pre>
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/couchbase/geocouch.git
</pre>

Compile (NB: change 1.4.0 below to the version you downloaded):

<pre>
cd ~/src/geocouch/
export COUCH_SRC=~/src/couchdb-1.4.0/src/couchdb
git checkout couchdb1.3.x
make
</pre>

NB: as of 2013-12, Debian unstable had CouchDB 1.4, although CouchDB 2.x now exists. GeoCouch must be built against the same version of CouchDB. There wasn't a 1.4 branch of geocouch, but it seems to compile correctly with the 1.3 branch, To see the available GeoCouch branches available, type "git branch -v -r".

After compilation, you probably want to install it somewhere outside a user directory, ex:

<pre>
sudo cp -r ebin /usr/local/lib/couchdb-geocouch
</pre>

And tell erlang ("man erl") to add that to the "code path". In Debian, this can be done in the /etc/default/couchdb file:

<pre>
ERL_FLAGS="-pa /usr/local/lib/couchdb-geocouch"
</pre>

Restart couchdb to make sure everything is OK:

<pre>
sudo service couchdb restart
</pre>
