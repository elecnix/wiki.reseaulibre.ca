# Introduction

"LibreMap is a scalable, global and decentralized router database and map visualization for community networks, such as guifi, Altermundi, FunkFeuer, ninux, freifunk, Commotion... It emerged around the is4cwn by merging the maps of AlterMap (Altermundi) and OpenWiFiMap (freifunk)."

* [[https://github.com/libremap/]] ("libremap-api" does the backend stuff, "libremap-webui" does the front end)
* [[http://libremap.net/]]
* [[http://libre-mesh.github.io/libremap-talk-2013-is4cwn/]]
* [[https://github.com/libremap/libremap-api/blob/master/doc-api.md]] (API documentation)

Features:

* REST API (http get/post/update) to add/edit node information, so it's easy to communicate with and extend.
* Database replication (using CouchDB), so it's possible to have our own local Montreal map, but also push our information upstream to the libremap.net map.
