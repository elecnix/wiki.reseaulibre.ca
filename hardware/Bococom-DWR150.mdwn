The C1291 or Top Link RT3-GWT is revealing its name! Bococom is a company in [[Shenzhen|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen]], China.

A search for Bococom leads to a thread on the DD-WRT forum about some people flashing a very similar router, but based on the Ralink 3052, which is the 300Mbit/s version, with two antennas instead of one.

http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=82160&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=30

It links to the OpenWRT forum with essentially the same flashing procedure, which involves using a serial cable.

https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=158105#p158105

The firmware they flash the router with is for the Aceex NR22/Y, and the same company also makes the NR11/Y which is 150 Mbit/s 1T1R, most likely using the same Ralink 3050 as our Bococom. There are still ongoing discussions as of today, march 28 2012. In the DD-WRT database, only the Aceex NR22/Y is listed.

Back to Bococom, they list the DWR150

There is no software available for download for this router on the Brococom web site:
