# Configuration guides

This page details how to configure your [[hardware]] for operation in
the mesh.

* [[configuration/ubnt-ad-hoc]] - configuration ad-hoc de base, sans mesh
* [[configuration/olsr+ipv6]] - configuration avec OLSR, IPv6 sur un [[nanostation]]
* [[configuration/flashing]] - flashing your device with the proper firmware

# Network topology

We need to decide of a topology. Opennet has an interesting concept, where public IPs are hidden behind VPN gateways:

This has a few advantages:

 1. strong over-the-air encryption
 2. no need to change gateway if network topology changes
 3. access to the internet only to subscribers

# IP allocation

We also need to think about how IPs are allocated, a constant sticky problem in mesh networks. [reseaucitoyen.be](http://reseaucitoyen.be) are suggesting to use IPv6 with the nodes' MAC addresses as a base, with tunnels for inter-mesh communication. The non-MAC part of the address remains to determine obviously...
