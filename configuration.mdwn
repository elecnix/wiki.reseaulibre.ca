This page details how to configure your [[hardware]] for operation in
the mesh.

There are also specific recipes in the [[guides]] section.

Those instructions attempt to be platform-independent or at least cover multiple platforms. This 4 step process should get you on the mesh, with full internet access if you are so privileged.

1. [[!traillink configuration/flashing]] - flashing your device with the proper firmware (optional - if you already have the software on your machine, just go to step 2)
2. [[!traillink configuration/ad-hoc]] - basic point to point configuration
3. [[!traillink configuration/batman]] - configuring mesh software for interconnexion (see also [[configuration/babel]], which we are not using right now)
4. [[!traillink configuration/ip]] - adress allocation on the network and connexion with the outside world, see also [[configuration/zeroconf]]
5. [[!traillink configuration/services]] - configure services for the mesh
6. [[!traillink configuration/vpn]] - interconnect mesh points with a VPN
