[[!meta description="How to setup secure gateways to the internet"]]

Just a brainstorm for now:

 1. no default route (0.0.0.0) should be announced unless people are really nice and want to give out free (and insecure) internet
 2. let's use [[openvpn]]
 3. we need to distribute certificates
 4. how do give access? through a client cert? or username/password? how do we revoke it?
