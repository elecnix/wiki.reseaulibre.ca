Bittorrent is a great way to distribute content over the mesh, because
it is decentralised. Multiple copies of the files can be distributed
over the network and shared, and Bittorent will figure out the optimal
way to download the files, even if the network is segmented.

We are currently sharing legal files, for example OpenWRT images, a
mirror of Wikipedia or OpenStreetMap tiles.

We use [public trackers](http://openbittorrent.com/) to share files,
and a tracker is also present on the mesh network itself. Through
Local Peer Discovery, you should also be able to discover the peers on
the local network even if that tracker is down.

Downloading Reseaulibre's software through bittorrent
=====================================================

Just download [[this torrent|reseaulibre-openwrt.torrent]] and open it
with your bittorrent client.

The images here are generated from this OpenWRT feed:

    git clone git://src.anarcat.ath.cx/reseaulibre-feed

How to create a torrent
=======================

Creating a torrent file is simple, and requires only a small piece of
software. Most Bittorrent clients ship with such a tool, however only
[qBittorrent](http://qbittorrent.org/) was able to generate a proper
torrent with support for [Web
seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)#Web_seeding). Web
seeding means we don't have to have files opened in a bittorrent
tracker, a web mirror is enough to seed the files. More specifically, we
are using the [Getright](http://www.getright.com/seedtorrent.html)
protocol.

Note that as Transmission
[doesn't support it yet](https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/4645),
and the [bittornado client](http://bittornado.com/) has its own
different protocol which is also used by
[Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org) and others.

Here are the list of trackers you should use:

    udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80
    udp://tracker.publicbt.com:80
    udp://tracker.ccc.de:80
    udp://tracker.istole.it:80

Then you also need to add the following as a webseed URL:

    http://packages.reseaulibre.ca:8080/Routeurs/

This is inspired by the way [Archive.org](http://archive.org/)
[host their files through Bittorent](https://archive.org/about/faqs.php#Archive_BitTorrents).

Hosting a Bittorrent tracker
============================

(!) In progress.

Hosting a
[Bittorrent tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker)
is fairly easy and can help the network's resilience in hosting
files. Amongst the
[different Bittorrent trackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_tracker_software),
we are looking into
[Opentracker](http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/) as it is
highly portable and is used by Archive.org.

See this howto:
<https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=58785>. A Debian request
for package has been filed: [[!debbug 685575]].
