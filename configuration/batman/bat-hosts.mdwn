You may have noticed that `batctl tcpdump` and other commands display MAC addresses, and tried to match these adresses to your network interfaces. Do no more! You can use our `bat-hosts` file to let batman display nice, user-friendly names (such as [[nodes/boulette]], our very first Ubiquiti "Bullet").

Here's a list of suggested MAC address to hostname translations for
BATMAN. This can be added directly to your `/etc/bat-hosts` to
facilitate reading `batctl` output.
