[[!meta title="Adding services to the mesh"]]

[[!toc levels=3]]

A mesh is fun, but otherwise not very useful until services are plugged into it. This means plugging some other devices (*servers*) into our open wireless network.

# Currently available services

 * DNS server at `172.16.0.1` / `fd64:2c08:9fa7:1::1` (`roadkiller.anarcat.ath.cx`)
 * http://mesh.openisp.ca/ - this wiki, should be running on
   `marcos.orangeseeds.org` (`2001:1928:1:9::1`), which should be
   routed by roadkiller, above
 * this wiki is also available through git
 * http://anarcat.ath.cx/ - various services, also available through
   `marcos`

# Naming your device

Assigning a name to your device is important because it allows you to
label it and identify it physically.

You should use the name you have chosen when creating the [[nodes]]
page here.

## OpenWRT

Set a custom name, in case you encouter other peers :-)

    uci set system.@system[0].hostname=meshmtl42

## Linux

    hostname meshmtl42
    hostname > /etc/hostname

## Other systems

In other systems, this can vary wildly, but there is usually a
configuration file for this.

# Providing your own services

Any service that will not disrupt other services should be allowed, although individual nodes may do some filtering to control quality of service.

## Replace OpenWRT's firewall with an open NAT service

Make sure the custom firewall ruleset is loaded:

    uci show | grep include

If not, add this:

    uci add firewall include
    uci set firewall.@include[0].path="/etc/firewall.user"

Then in `/etc/firewall.user`:

[[!format sh """
#! /bin/sh

# set saneunsafe but open defaults
iptables -P INPUT   ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT  ACCEPT
# drop forward - only NAT'd packets allowed
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

# get rid of the openwrt firewall
iptables -X
iptables -F
iptables -t mangle -F
iptables -t mangle -X
iptables -t raw -F
iptables -t raw -X
iptables -t nat -F
iptables -t nat -X

route_nat() {
  intif="$1"
  extif="$2"
  echo "configuring nat from $intif to $extif"
  iptables -A FORWARD -i $extif -o $intif -m state  --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
  iptables -A FORWARD -i $intif -o $extif -j ACCEPT
  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o $extif -j MASQUERADE
}

route_nat wlan0 br-mesh
"""]]

The above will clear all firewall rules, allowing all traffic through the node. It assumes you have another router doing some filtering downstream, if not you will need to customize that firewall according to your policy, below.

## Providing DHCP and IPv6

The following will enable DHCP and IPv6 on the router:

[[!format txt """
uci set dhcp.wlan0=dhcp
uci set dhcp.wlan0.interface=wlan0
uci set dhcp.wlan0.start=100
uci set dhcp.wlan0.limit=150
uci set dhcp.wlan0.leasetime=1h
"""]]

[[!format sh """
uci add radvd prefix
uci set radvd.@prefix[1]=prefix
uci set radvd.@prefix[1].interface=wlan0
uci set radvd.@prefix[1].AdvOnLink=1
uci set radvd.@prefix[1].AdvAutonomous=1
uci set radvd.@prefix[1].ignore=0
uci set radvd.@prefix[1].prefix="fd64:2c08:9fa7:2::/64"
uci set radvd.@prefix[1].AdvRouterAddr=1
uci add radvd interface
uci set radvd.@interface[1]=interface
uci set radvd.@interface[1].interface=wlan0
uci set radvd.@interface[1].AdvSendAdvert=1
uci set radvd.@interface[1].AdvManagedFlag=0
uci set radvd.@interface[1].AdvOtherConfigFlag=0
uci set radvd.@interface[1].ignore=0
"""]]

Make sure you have configured an IP on wlan0, using the [[ip]] configuration rules. For example:

[[!format sh """
uci set network.wlan0.proto=static
uci set network.wlan0.ipaddr="192.168.4.1"
uci set network.wlan0.netmask="255.255.255.0"
uci set network.wlan0.ip6addr="fd64:2c08:9fa7:2::1/64"
uci commit
"""]]

## DNS services

By default, OpenWRT provides a DNS server through DNSmasq, however it relies on an upstream DNS server. To provide a "real" DNS server, you can try [MaraDNS](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dns.maradns) or the `bind-server` package.

However, there may yet be DNS servers on the mesh, which your router can use. Let's assume that `172.16.0.1` is a DNS server, then the following should enable your router to be a DNS cache:

    rm /etc/resolv.conf
    echo 'nameserver 172.16.0.1' > /etc/resolv.conf
    uci set dhcp.@dnsmasq[0].resolvfile=/etc/resolv.conf
    uci commit
    /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart

This is taken from [the OpenWRT howto](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/dhcp.dnsmasq#add.a.secondary.dns).

## Providing some services behind a firewall

A good approach is to allocate a specific port on your firewall and allow it only some access to your internal network, and, maybe, the internet.

First, you need to determine the policy. Here is [[anarcat]]'s:

 * no DHCP on the interface - we do not want to pollute the LAN
 * use up one IP in the IPv4 network (192.168.3.1 for my node, use
   your own!)
 * publish an IPv6 /64 network (minimum size), see above for
   configuration and allocation
 * block packets by default
 * allow to my server: port  SSH (22)
   * HTTP (80)
   * HTTPS (443)
   * IMAPS (993)
   * XMPP (5222)
   * OpenVPN (1194)
   * git (9418)
   * streaming/icecast (8000)
   * jukebox/MPD (6600)
   * outgoing ICMP

### OpenBSD's pf implementation

The above rules can be done with the following patch to a pf.conf, for
OpenBSD's PF (Packet Filter):

To allow access to the internet in general, I also throw in those
rules:

 * allow to everywhere:
   * port SSH (22)
   * HTTP (80)
   * HTTPS (443)
   * IMAPS (993)
   * XMPP (5222)
   * OpenVPN (1194)
   * git (9418)
   * SMTP submissions (587)
   * outgoing ICMP

## Advertising your services on the mesh

Then those services can be advertised in different ways:

 * through protocols like
   "[Zeroconf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_configuration_networking)"
   ([Avahi](http://www.avahi.org/) in Linux, Bonjour in Apple, SSDP in
   Microsoft
 * by documenting it in this page, above

# Allowing or preventing wireless clients inter-communication

You may wish to allow or prevent wireless clients connected your node to communicate with wireless clients from other nodes. Batman has a feature to control this called Ap-Isolation. Note that this allows/prevents *wireless* clients of different nodes from communicating, but not *wired* clients, and also does not block broadcast or multicast packets if it is activated. Also, this does not prevent communication between wireless clients connected to the same node. This should be managed at another level on the AP. So far, I've only found the "isolate" flag in OpenWRT's interface configuration, but this only works with AP mode. What about ad-hoc?

To toggle Ap-isolation:

    batctl ap_isolation 1

or

    batctl ap 1

More information about this on the [[batman-adv wiki|http://www.open-mesh.org/wiki/batman-adv/Ap-isolation]]
