Babel configuration notes
=========================

are only experimenting with this technology at this point, so to join
the mesh you should rather look at [[batman]] for now.

From the
[FAQ](http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~jch/software/babel/faq.html):

You can ask Babel to dump its internal tables. With the standalone daemon, send a HUP1 signal to the daemon to get it to dump its tables to the log file. With the quagga version, type

show babel interface
show babel neighbour
show babel route

Tcpdump groks Babel starting with version 4.2.1. Wireshark has support since version 1.6.0.
