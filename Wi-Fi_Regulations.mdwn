Annex 8 

" (4) For systems employing digital modulation techniques operating in the bands 902-928 MHz, 2400-2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850 MHz, the maximum peak conducted output power shall not exceed 1 W. Except as provided in Section A8.4(5), the e.i.r.p. shall not exceed 4 W."

That means the radio can be 1 Watt maximum(30dBm).
The sum of the radio power and antenna gain (E.I.R.P.) should not exceed 4 Watts (36dBm).

ex: with a 15dBi antenna, maximum power from the radio should be 21dBm (126 mW).

EXCEPT:

" (5) Point-to-point systems in the bands 2400-2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850 MHz are permitted to have an e.i.r.p. higher than 4 W, provided that the higher e.i.r.p. is achieved by employing higher gain directional antennas and not higher transmitter output powers. Point-to-multipoint systems, omni-directional applications and multiple co-located transmitters transmitting the same information are prohibited from exceeding 4 W e.i.r.p. However, remote stations of point-to-multipoint systems shall be allowed to operate at greater than 4 W e.i.r.p, under the same conditions as for point-to-point systems."

This means that a PTP with a 30dBm (1 Watt) radio and a 32dbi antenna can use 1600 Watts e.i.r.p.

Mesh Access Points cannot be in that category because they are designed to serve multiple links.
